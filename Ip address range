What is an IP Address Subnet?
An IP Address Subnet, also known as a "subnetwork", is the efficient allocation of an IP network in blocks of IP addresses. Class A Blocks end with "/8" and contain 16 million IP addresses. Class B Blocks end with "/16" and contain 65,000 IP addresses. Class C Blocks end with "/24" and support a maximum of 254 IP addresses.

Class A Example - 1.1.1.0/8 - 16 Million Hosts
Class B Example - 1.1.1.0/16 - 65,000 Hosts
Class C Example - 1.1.1.0/24 - 254 Hosts
What is CIDR notation?
CIDR format, or "Classless Inter-Domain Routing", released in 1993, is the industry standard for displaying IP addresses and their related subnets. It consists of a network prefix and the significant bits which determines the size of the IP block. Significant bits are in 8-bit groups that form Class A, B, and C blocks of IP addresses. An example of CIDR format is "255.254.0.0/16", which indicates there are 65,000 hosts in this range from "255.254.0.1" to "255.254.255.255".

Ready to eliminate fraud?
Start fighting fraud in minutes!All I had to do was initialize a DHCP server with the proper netname (e.g. mynetwork) running the following command:

$ VBoxManage dhcpserver add --netname mynetwork --ip 11.11.11.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0 --lowerip 11.11.11.3 --upperip 11.11.11.20 --enable

Of course also the ips depend on what you need.
