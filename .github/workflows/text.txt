You only need an existing GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that lints multiple coding languages using the GitHub Super-Linter action. The workflow uses Super-Linter to validate your source code every time a new commit is pushed to your repository.

Creating your first workflow
From your repository on GitHub, create a new file in the .github/workflows directory named superlinter.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the superlinter.yml file. Note: If your default branch is not main, update the value of DEFAULT_BRANCH to match your repository's default branch name.

YAML
name: Super-Linter

# Run this workflow every time a new commit pushed to your repository
on: push

jobs:
  # Set the job key. The key is displayed as the job name
  # when a job name is not provided
  super-lint:
    # Name the Job
    name: Lint code base
    # Set the type of machine to run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks out a copy of your repository on the ubuntu-latest machine
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs the Super-Linter action
      - name: Run Super-Linter
        uses: github/super-linter@v3
        env:
          DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
