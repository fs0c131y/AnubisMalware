Introduction
There are about 33 blood group systems discovered till date, of which most commonly used systems are ABO system and Rhesus (Rh) system of blood groups. These blood group systems are made on the basis of certain antigens present on red blood cells (RBCs).[1]It is of utmost importance to have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the blood group systems, their clinical significance and blood group linked diseases.
ABO is a classification of human blood group based on the presence or absence of A or B antigens. The most common of ABO blood types is blood group ‘O’ whereas most rare is blood group ‘AB’.[1] The origin of these blood types still remains a great scientific mystery. In 1930, furthering research on blood, Landsteiner repeated the procedure using human blood and rabbit blood. There he found a common factor between the Rhesus monkey blood and human blood in its clumping response, dubbing the factor as Rh-positive – having the same factor as the Rhesus monkey.[3]
